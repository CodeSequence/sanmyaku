# Foundation for Vanilla

[![Release](http://img.shields.io/github/release/kasperisager/vanilla-foundation.svg)](https://github.com/kasperisager/vanilla-foundation/releases) [![Dependency Status](https://gemnasium.com/kasperisager/vanilla-foundation.svg)](https://gemnasium.com/kasperisager/vanilla-foundation)

## Getting started

To get started using Foundation for Vanilla, either:

* [__Download the latest release__](https://github.com/kasperisager/vanilla-foundation/releases)
* Clone the repository directly into your Vanilla `themes` directory:

```sh
$ git clone kasperisager/vanilla-foundation foundation
```

## Compiling assets

Foundation for Vanilla was scaffolded using [Ninja](https://github.com/kasperisager/vanilla-ninja). For instructions on how to install the development dependencies and front-end components, please refer to the [Ninja documentation](https://github.com/kasperisager/vanilla-ninja#getting-started). Once you've got everything set up, use the following tasks to re-compile the theme assets:

#### Build - `gulp`
Runs the default Gulp task which will compile all theme assets. Sass stylesheets will be compiled to [`design/style.css`](design/style.css) and Javascripts will be concatenated and output to [`js/custom.js`](js/custom.js).

#### Watch - `gulp watch`
Starts an instance of [tiny-lr](https://github.com/mklabs/tiny-lr) (a tiny LiveReload server) that watches the compiled assets for changes and pushes these to your Vanilla installation automatically whenever they change.

## [Issue tracking](https://github.com/kasperisager/vanilla-foundation/issues)
