## Getting started

To get started using Sanmyaku for Vanilla, either:

* [__Download the latest release__](https://github.com/codesequence/sanmyaku/releases)
* Clone the repository directly into your Vanilla `themes` directory:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/CodeSequence/sanmyaku.git
```
## prerequisites
You will need to following tools globally installed to build this theme:

* node  ~v5.5.0
* npm   ~3.3.12
* bower ~1.4.1

## Compiling assets

Run `npm install` to get started.

#### Build - `gulp build`
Runs the default Gulp task which will compile all theme assets.
* JavaScripts will be concatenated and output to (js/custom.js).
* Sass stylesheets will be compiled to (design/custom.css).
* Sass theme-option stylesheets will be prefixed with `custom_` and compiled to (design/custom_themeoptionname.css).
* Images are optimized and placed in (app/images).
* Theme screenshots are optimized and place in (design/imagename.png).
* Icons are compiled to (app/icons).


#### Watch - `gulp`
Starts the build process and then uses browserync to watch and update the browser on changes.
To use the watch process you will need to update your (`gulp/config.js`) `projectUrl` to be the url used for development.

#### Theme Options
The theme comes pre-configured with a light and dark theme. Light is the default and dark can be set under theme options in the admin panel.

#### Mobile Theme
Sanmyaku is built to be responsive. To set this theme as your mobile theme you will need to manually edit the vanilla forums `conf/config.php`

Update or add `$Configuration['Garden']['MobileTheme'] = 'sanmyaku';`.

#### Easily Customizable
The theme is easy to customize. Simply update the variables located in the  `app/scss/theme_options/dark/_settings.scss` file to easily change fonts, colors & images. Another option is to copy the dark theme directory and create a new theme folder and sass file with the name of your theme that imports the new theme folder. You will then need to add the theme options name to `about.php` file after `'Dark'   => '%s_dark'`.

If you have built an awesome color scheme and want to share it with the community, submit a pull request!
