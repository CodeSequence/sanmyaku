## Getting started

To get started using Foundation for Vanilla, either:

* [__Download the latest release__](https://github.com/codesequence/vanilla-foundation/releases)
* Clone the repository directly into your Vanilla `themes` directory:

```sh
$ git clone codesequence/vanilla-foundation foundation
```

## Compiling assets

Run `npm install` to get started.

#### Build - `gulp build`
Runs the default Gulp task which will compile all theme assets.
* Javascripts will be concatenated and output to (js/custom.js).
* Sass stylesheets will be compiled to (design/custom.css).
*Sass theme-option stylesheets will be prefixed with `custom_` and compiled to (design/custom_themeoptionname.css).
* Images are optimized and placed in (app/images).
* Theme screenshots are optimized and place in (design/imagename.png).
* Icons are compiled to (app/icons).


#### Watch - `gulp`
Starts the build process and then uses browserync to watch and update the browser on changes.
To use the watch process you will need to update your (`gulp/config.js`) `projectUrl` to be the url used by homestead to access the vanilla instance.

#### Theme Options
The actual theme is contained in theme options that must be set through the admin dashboard.
